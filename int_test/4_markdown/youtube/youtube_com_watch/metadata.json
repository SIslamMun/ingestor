  "description": "Want to take Large Language Models (LLMs) to the next level? In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to fine-tune smaller models for math and coding tasks and integrate them into an AI reasoning agent that outperforms vanilla LLMs! \n\nWhat You’ll Learn:\n✅ Why vanilla LLMs struggle with reasoning-intensive tasks\n✅ How to fine-tune smaller models on math & coding datasets\n✅ How to build an AI agent that applies logical reasoning\n✅ Step-by-step implementation using function calling & tool integration\n\nThis approach reduces hallucinations, improves logical problem-solving, and enhances accuracy—a must-know for AI developers and machine learning engineers!\n\n📌 Resources & Links:\n🔗 Fine-tuning tutorial: https://youtu.be/_OX_T-2R5Ao\n🔗 Blog: https://ubiai.tools/fine-tune-llm-for-agentic-reasoning-to-demonstrate-better-performance-compared-to-vanilla-llms/\n\n💬 Have questions or ideas?
