## Transcript

February 18th, 2021. NASA's Perseverance rover pierces through the thin Martian atmosphere, descending at 13,000 mph. The world watches as the most advanced rover ever built touches down on the Jezero crater, a place that might hold evidence of ancient life. As its onboard cameras capture the first highresolution images of an alien world, a surprising technology runs behind the scenes. Not C++, not Java. Python. Yes, Python. A language originally built in 1989 as a holiday side project by Dutch programmer Guaido Van Rossum is now powering space exploration. It helps NASA process images, analyze terrain, and even control robotic instruments millions of miles away. But Python's path to global dominance wasn't as smooth as its syntax. It was once dismissed as too slow. It fought a brutal community split that nearly tore it apart. For years, developers scoffed at its enforced indentation, its so-called weak performance, and the notion that a scripting language could ever compete with Java or C++. And yet, today, Python is everywhere, from AI research labs to Wall Street, from Hollywood visual effects to cyber security, from Google's backend to NASA's mission control. So, how did a simple scripting language evolve into one of the most powerful forces in modern computing? This is Python's untold story, a saga of innovation, controversy, and survival. Our story begins in the late 1980s in the Netherlands. Dutch programmer Guido Van Rossam working at a research institute CWI decided to build his own scripting language as a holiday hobby project. He had worked with a teaching language called ABC and wanted a more practical extensible successor for everyday programming. By December 1989, Guido had started coding what would become Python and released the first version in early 1991. Why Python? Van Rosom, a fan of the irreverent British comedy MontiPython's Flying Circus, picked the name not after the snake, but the comedy group. The whimsical name disguised the seriousness of the vision behind the language. From the outset, Python's design set it apart. Guido wasn't trying to build the fastest language, but the most approachable. He envisioned an easy and intuitive language just as powerful as major competitors with code that reads like plain English. Python's design emphasized readability from the start, indentation over braces, clean syntax, and a consistent minimalist approach. The guiding mantra, there should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it. It prioritized readability and clarity, helping users write and understand code with minimal friction. This vision materialized in a language open to everyone, scriptable yet powerful, with a robust standard library out of the box. In February 1991, Guido shared his creation on Usenet and Python was born. But it still needed a user base in a world filled with other programming languages. Before we explore how Python found its first true believers, here's a quick word from Floppy Data.

Now, back to the story of Python because while it started small, the 1990s would prove pivotal in shaping its rise. In the 1990s, Python was an outsider. Distributed via FTP and mailing lists, it had to compete with Pearl and a rising star, Java. Pearl, created in 1987, dominated the scripting world with its flexibility and early web usage. Java, launched in 1995, offered enterprise strength and wide platform compatibility. Python's readability quietly attracted academics, hackers, and programmers disillusioned by Pearl's complexity and lack of consistency, where Pearl embraced multiple ways to solve a problem. Python favored consistency. As one early user said, "Good Python code has a very obvious structure." This readability began converting believers. A light-hearted rivalry grew between Python and Pel communities, both powerful but philosophically opposed. While Pel was the web's duct tape, Python became the clean, elegant alternative. The real breakout came with the internet's second wave in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Web apps were booming and Python was ready. Then came Google. In the 2000s, the search giant adopted Python for internal tools and back-end systems. Their motto, Python where we can, C++ where we must. They even hired Guido Van Rossom in 2005. Google's endorsement gave Python a credibility boost no grassroots community alone could achieve. Meanwhile, Python 2 was released in 2000, introducing garbage collection and Unicode support. Web frameworks like Django and Flask emerged, offering both comprehensive and minimalist approaches to web development. While the Python package index grew rapidly, Python's ecosystem flourished. Yet, even as it grew, new threats emerged. But another wave was coming. This time powered by data. The 2010s marked Python's explosive rise in data science and machine learning. Libraries like NumPai, Pandas, and Scikitlearn made Python the language of choice for analysts and researchers. When TensorFlow and PyTorch arrived, Python became the front end for modern AI development. Even longtime R users began migrating, drawn by Python's growing ecosystem and ease of use. Python wasn't just powering websites anymore. It was driving global insights, training neural networks, and unlocking the potential of big data. Tools like Anaconda made scientific Python easy to use. While Jupyter Notebooks revolutionized how researchers shared and visualized their work, blending narrative code, and results in one place. Yet, while Python was gaining ground in science and research, the world of web development was rapidly shifting. Ruby on Rails captivated startups. JavaScript conquered the browser. Mobile development exploded, an area where Python lacked native strength. For a time, it seemed Python might remain an academic tool rather than a force in modern software. Over three decades, Python's evolution followed a steady arc of innovation. It began in 1991 with version 0.9 introducing clean syntax and scriptable power. In 2000, Python 2 added Unicode support and garbage collection, fueling community growth. Then came the pivotal Python 3. In 2008, a bold but controversial rewrite that resolved long-standing issues. In the 2010s and beyond, Python embraced asyncing programming, type hints, and performance improvements, ensuring its relevance in a rapidly evolving tech landscape. Python 3 marked a turning point. Its backward incompatible changes forced a decadel long migration, but ultimately modernized the language and ensured its future. Python 2 was finally retired in 2020. Technical challenges remained. The global interpreter lock GIL limited multi-threading leading to debates. Alternatives like pi and proposals to remove the gil aimed to address performance concerns. Governance also shifted. In 2018, after fierce and draining debates over proposed syntax changes like the walrus operator, Guido stepped down from his leadership role. The decision shocked the community after nearly 30 years at the helm. Python's creator had walked away weary from the burden of balancing vision and consensus. Yet, the language kept moving forward, fueled by its community. And that community wasn't just a loose network of users. It was organized, passionate, and global. The Python Software Foundation helped guide its growth. Events like Pyon held around the world turned Python into a social movement. Developers came not just to code, but to mentor, teach, and build a better future together. Now in its fourth decade, Python faces both competition and opportunity. Version 3.11 brought major speed improvements, and future versions may remove the GIL entirely. New challenges are targeting Python's weak spots. Julia, for instance, shines in scientific computing, but struggles with ecosystem depth. Rust offers C++ level performance and is increasingly used to speed up Python internals. Meanwhile, Mojo combines Python simplicity with C++ speed, positioning itself to transform AI development workflows. Still, Python's massive community, robust libraries, and flexibility make it tough to replace. From scripting in Blender and controlling Maya in animation studios to automating Excel and serving as a control layer in Rustpowered engines, Python's flexibility continues to grow. Widow's vision, computer programming for everybody, took shape through Python's unexpected influence in education, startups, and global open-source collaboration. Python made code accessible. Mattplot Lib and Seabour brought data to life with powerful visualization tools. PIP and Virtualenth gave developers control over dependencies and environments critical for modern workflows. The Hour of Code initiative brought Python to classrooms worldwide, helping millions take their first steps into programming. In Hollywood, Python orchestrated lighting rigs and special effects in blockbusters like The Mandalorian. It opened doors to students, scientists, and creators alike. It didn't just power scripts, it powered dreams. As long as there are problems to solve and ideas to build, Python will be there, adapting, inspiring, and writing the next chapter of innovation, one line at a time. And somewhere on the red dust of Jazer Crater, Perseverance continues its mission. Powered in part by the quiet strength of Python code written millions of miles away.
