SciPy is an open-source scientific computing library for the Python programming language. Since its initial release in 2001, SciPy has become a de facto standard for leveraging scientific algorithms in Python, with over 600 unique code contributors, thousands of dependent packages, over 100,000 dependent repositories and millions of downloads per year. In this work, we provide an overview of the capabilities and development practices of SciPy 1.0 and highlight some recent technical developments.

S ciPy is a library of numerical routines for the Python programming  language  that  provides  fundamental  building  blocks for modeling and solving scientific problems. SciPy includes algorithms for optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems,  algebraic  equations,  differential  equations  and  many other  classes  of  problems;  it  also  provides  specialized  data  structures,  such  as  sparse  matrices  and k -dimensional  trees.  SciPy  is built on top of NumPy 1,2 , which provides array data structures and related  fast  numerical  routines,  and  SciPy  is  itself  the  foundation upon which higher level scientific libraries, including scikit-learn 3 and scikit-image 4 , are built. Scientists, engineers and others around the world rely on SciPy. For example, published scripts 5,6 used  in the analysis of gravitational waves 7,8 import several subpackages of SciPy, and the M87 black hole imaging project cites SciPy 9 .

Recently, SciPy released version 1.0, a milestone that traditionally signals  a  library's  API  (application  programming  interface)  being mature enough to be trusted in production pipelines. This version numbering convention, however, belies the history of a project that has become the standard others follow and has seen extensive adoption in research and industry.

SciPy's arrival at this point is surprising and somewhat anomalous. When started in 2001, the library had little funding and was written  mainly  by  graduate  students-many  of  them  without  a computer science education and often without the blessing of their advisors. To even imagine that a small group of 'rogue' student programmers could upend the already well-established ecosystem of research software-backed by millions in funding and many hundreds of highly qualified engineers 10-12 -was preposterous.

Yet  the  philosophical  motivations  behind  a  fully  open  tool stack,  combined with an excited, friendly community with a singular focus, have proven auspicious in the long run. They led not only  to  the  library  described  in  this  paper,  but  also  to  an  entire ecosystem of related packages (https://wiki.python.org/moin/ NumericAndScientific)  and  a  variety  of  social  activities  centered around  them  (https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonConferences). The  packages  in  the  SciPy  ecosystem  share  high  standards  of

## PERSPECTIVE

implementation, documentation and testing, and a culture eager to learn and adopt better practices-both for community management and software development.

## Background

Here we capture a selective history of some milestones and important events in the growth of SciPy. Despite what we highlight here, it is important to understand that a project like SciPy is only possible because of the contributions of very many contributors-too many to  mention individually, but each bringing an important piece to the puzzle.

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose computer programming language, designed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s, with a dynamic type system and an emphasis on readability and  rapid  prototyping 13 (https://github.com/python/cpython).  As a  general-purpose  programming language, it had no special support for scientific data structures or algorithms, unlike many of the other established computation platforms of the time. Yet scientists soon discovered the language's virtues, such as its ability to wrap C and Fortran libraries, and to then drive those libraries interactively. Scientists  could  thereby  gain  access  to  a  wide  variety  of  existing computational libraries  without  concerning  themselves  with  lowlevel programming concepts such as memory management.

In 1995, Jim Hugunin, a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute  of  Technology,  wrote  the  first  message  in  a  new  Python Matrix Special Interest Group (Matrix-SIG) mailing list 14 :

'There seems to be a fair amount of interest in the Python community concerning the addition of numeric operations to Python. My own desire is to have as large a library of matrix based functions available as possible (linear algebra, eigenfunctions, signal processing, statistics, etc.). In order to ensure that all of these libraries interoperate, there needs to be agreement on a basic matrix object that can be used to represent arrays of numbers. '

Over the next several months, conversations on that mailing list by, among others, Jim Fulton, Jim Hugunin, Paul Dubois, Konrad Hinsen  and  Guido  van  Rossum  led  to  the  creation  of  a  package called  Numeric with an array object that supported a high number of dimensions. Jim Hugunin explained the utility of Python for numerical computation 15 :

'I've used almost all of the available numerical languages at one time or another over the past 8 years. One thing I've noticed is that over time, the designers of these languages are steadily adding more of the features that one would expect to find in a generalpurpose programming language.'

This remains a distinguishing feature of Python for science and one of the reasons why it has been so successful in the realm of data science: instead of adding general features to a language designed for numerical and scientific computing, here scientific features are added to a general-purpose language. This broadens the scope of problems that can be addressed easily, expands the sources of data that are readily accessible and increases the size of the community that develops code for the platform.

SciPy begins. By the late 1990s, discussions appeared on Matrix-SIG expressing a desire for a complete scientific data analysis environment 16 . Travis Oliphant, a PhD student at the Mayo Clinic, released a  number  of  packages 17,18 that  built  on  top  of  the  Numeric  array package,  and  provided  algorithms  for  signal  processing,  special functions,  sparse  matrices,  quadrature,  optimization,  fast  Fourier transforms  and  more.  One  of  these  packages,  Multipack  (http:// pylab.sourceforge.net/multipack.html), was a set of extension modules that wrapped Fortran and C libraries to solve nonlinear equations and least-squares problems, integrate differential  equations and fit splines. Robert Kern, then an undergraduate student

Box 1 | Excerpt from the SciPy 0.1 release announcement (typos corrected), posted 20 August 2001 on the Python-list mailing list

SciPy is an open-source package that builds on the strengths of Python and Numeric, providing a wide range of fast scientific and numeric functionality. SciPy's current module set includes the following:

- Special functions (Bessel, Hankel, Airy and others)
- Signal/image processing
- 2D plotting capabilities
- Integration
- ODE solvers
- Optimization (simplex, BFGS, Newton-CG and others)
- Genetic algorithms
- Numeric to C ++ expression compiler
- Parallel programming tools
- Splines and interpolation
- Other items

(and  currently  a  SciPy  core  developer),  provided  compilation instructions under Windows.  Around  the  same  time, Pearu Peterson, a PhD student from Estonia, released F2PY 19 , a command line tool for binding Python and Fortran codes, and wrote modules for  linear  algebra  and  interpolation.  Eric  Jones,  while  a  graduate student at Duke University, wrote packages to support his dissertation, including a parallel job scheduler and genetic optimizer. Gary Strangman, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School, published several descriptive and inferential statistical routines 20 .

With a rich programming environment and a numerical array object in place, the time was ripe for the development of a full scientific software stack. In 2001, Eric Jones and Travis Vaught founded Enthought Scientific Computing Solutions (now Enthought, Inc.) in Austin, Texas, USA. To simplify the tool stack, they created the SciPy project, centered around the SciPy library, which would subsume all the above-mentioned packages. The new project quickly gained momentum, with a website and code repository 21  appearing  in  February,  and  a  mailing  list  announced 22 in  June  2001.  By August 2001, a first release was announced 23 ,  an excerpt of which is shown in Box 1. In September, the first documentation was published 24 . The first SciPy workshop 25 was held in September 2002 at Caltech-a single track, two-day event with 50 participants, many of them developers of SciPy and surrounding libraries.

At this point, scientific Python started attracting more serious attention;  code  that  started  as  side  projects  by  graduate  students had  grown  into  essential  infrastructure  at  national  laboratories and  research  institutes.  For  example,  Paul  Dubois  at  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) took over the maintenance of Numeric and funded the writing of its manual 26 ,  and the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), which was in charge of Hubble Space Telescope science operations, decided to replace their custom scripting  language  and  analysis  pipeline  with  Python 27 .  As  STScI continued  to  use  Python  for  an  increasingly  large  portion  of  the Hubble  Space  Telescope  data  analysis  pipeline,  they  encountered problems with the Python numerical array container. Numeric, the original array package, was suitable for small arrays, but not for the large  images  processed  by  STScI.  With  the  Numeric  maintainer's blessing,  the  decision  was  made  to  write  NumArray 28 ,  a  library that could handle data on a larger scale. Unfortunately, NumArray proved inefficient for small arrays, presenting the community with a  rather  unfortunate  choice.  In  2005,  Travis  Oliphant  combined the best elements of Numeric and NumArray, thereby solving the dilemma. NumPy 1.0 was released 29  in October 2006, paving the way for the reunified scientific Python community to mature.

## Box 2 | Package organization

The SciPy library is organized as a collection of subpackages. The 16 subpackages include mathematical building blocks (for example,  linear  algebra,  Fourier  transforms,  special  functions),  data structures  (for  example,  sparse  matrices, k -D  trees),  algorithms (for example, numerical optimization and integration, clustering, interpolation,  graph  algorithms,  computational  geometry)  and higher-level  data  analysis  functionality  (for  example,  signal  and image processing, statistical methods).

Here we summarize the scope and capabilities of each subpackage. Additional information is available in the SciPy tutorial (https:// docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/)  and  API  reference (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/index.html#apireference).

cluster

The cluster subpackage contains cluster.vq , which provides vector quantization and k -means algorithms, and cluster.hierarchy , which provides functions for hierarchical and agglomerative clustering.

constants

Physical  and  mathematical  constants,  including  the  CODATA recommended values of the fundamental physical constants 119 .

fftpack

Fast Fourier Transform routines. In addition to the FFT itself, the subpackage  includes  functions  for  the  discrete  sine  and  cosine transforms and for pseudo-differential operators.

integrate

The integrate subpackage  provides  tools  for  the  numerical computation of single and multiple definite integrals and for the solution of ordinary differential equations, including initial value problems and two-point boundary value problems.

interpolate

The interpolate subpackage  contains  spline  functions  and classes, one-dimensional and multi-dimensional (univariate and  multivariate)  interpolation  classes,  Lagrange  and  Taylor polynomial  interpolators, and  wrappers  for FITPACK 53   and DFITPACK functions.

io

A  collection  of  functions  and  classes  for  reading  and  writing Matlab (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), IDL,  Matrix  Market 120 ,  Fortran,  NetCDF 121 ,  Harwell-Boeing 122 , WAV and ARFF data files.

linalg

Linear algebra functions, including elementary  functions  of a  matrix,  such  as  the  trace,  determinant,  norm  and  condition number; basic solver for Ax = b ;  specialized solvers for Toeplitz matrices, circulant matrices, triangular matrices and other structured matrices; least-squares solver and  pseudo-inverse calculations;  eigenvalue  and  eigenvector  calculations  (basic  and generalized); matrix decompositions, including Cholesky, Schur, Hessenberg, LU , LDL T , QR , QZ ,  singular  value  and  polar;  and functions to create specialized matrices, such as diagonal, Toeplitz, Hankel, companion, Hilbert and more.

ndimage

## misc

A collection of functions that did not fit into the other subpackages. Although  this  subpackage  still  exists  in  SciPy  1.0,  an  effort  is underway to deprecate or relocate the contents of this subpackage and remove it.

odr

Orthogonal  distance  regression,  including  Python  wrappers  for the Fortran library ODRPACK 54 .

optimize

This subpackage includes simplex and interior-point linear programming solvers, implementations of many nonlinear minimization algorithms, a routine for least-squares curve fitting, and a collection of general nonlinear solvers for root-finding.

## special

The name comes from the class of functions traditionally known as special functions, but over time, the subpackage has grown to include functions beyond the classical special functions. A more appropriate  characterization  of  this  subpackage  is  simply  useful functions.  It  includes  a  large  collection  of  the  classical  special functions such as Airy, Bessel and others; families of orthogonal polynomials;  the  Gamma  function,  and  functions  related  to  it; functions for computing the PDF, CDF and quantile function for several  probability  distributions;  information  theory  functions; combinatorial functions comb and factorial ; and more.

## PERSPECTIVE

SciPy matures. By the middle to late 2000s, SciPy was starting to mature after a long phase of significant growth and adoption. The scope of the SciPy library narrowed, while the breadth of the ecosystem  grew  through  a  new  type  of  auxiliary  package:  the  scikit (https://www.scipy.org/scikits.html), a complementary library developed  outside  SciPy,  allowing  for  more  rapid  exploration  of experimental ideas while maintaining familiar style and development methodology. In SciPy itself, tooling, development, documentation and release processes became more professional. The library was expanded carefully, with the patience affordable in open-source projects and via best practices, which are increasingly common in the scientific Python ecosystem and industry 30 .

Early  versions  of  SciPy  had  minimal  documentation,  but  this began to change with the 2006 release of a Guide to NumPy 1 . In 2007, Sphinx 31 made it possible to render hypertext and PDF documents automatically from plain text (docstrings) interspersed with Python code, and in 2008, pydocweb 32 enabled collaborative documentation development in a wiki-like fashion. The SciPy Documentation Project 33,34 used  these  tools  to  complete  documentation of SciPy's user-facing  functionality:  offering  t-shirts  to  contributors  from around the world in exchange for high-quality text, it collected contributions from over 75 people to produce an 884-page manual 35 . Since  then,  SciPy  has  remained  committed  to  maintaining  highquality documentation as part of the normal development cycle.

In the early SciPy workshops, recurrent topics reflected the state of  development,  with  emphasis  being  placed  on  the  underlying array package, plotting, parallel processing, acceleration/wrapping and user interfaces. By 2004, presentations about the application of SciPy to scientific problems began to appear. The event also started to  draw  in  more  keynote  speakers  from  outside  the  community, such as Guido van Rossum (creator of Python, 2006), Ivan Krstić (One Laptop per Child,  2007),  Alex  Martelli  (Google,  2008)  and Peter Norvig (Google Research, 2009). The informal workshop grew from a small gathering of core developers into an international conference with hundreds of attendees, increased funding, a published proceedings and scholarships for attending students. By 2010, the US SciPy conference had multiple tracks, and satellite conferences were being organized by volunteers elsewhere, such as EuroSciPy (since  2008)  and  SciPy  India  (since  2009).  Special  sessions  and minisymposia  dedicated  to  scientific  Python  began  appearing  at many other events. For example, a three-part minisymposium organized for International Conferences on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) 2009 was featured in SIAM News 36 .

In 2007, Python had a strong enough presence in science and engineering  that  the  editors  of IEEE  Computing  in  Science  and Engineering solicited  a  special  issue  about  Python  in  science 37 , edited by Paul Dubois. However, Python was still sufficiently niche that  the  average  reader  would  need  additional  information  to decide whether it would be useful in their own work. The followup March/April 2011 Python for Scientists and Engineers special issue 38 focused more on the core parts of the scientific Python ecosystem 39 including NumPy 2 , Cython 40 and Mayavi 41 . Python became so pervasive that journals began publishing domain-specific special issues.  For  example,  in  2015, Frontiers  in  Neuroinformatics published a collection of 25 articles-covering topics including modeling and simulation, data collection, electrophysiology, visualization as well as stimulus generation and presentation-called Python in Neuroscience 42 .

SciPy  today. As  of  February  2019,  the  SciPy  library  consists  of nearly 600,000 lines of open-source code organized in 16 subpackages summarized in Box 2. The development team and community currently interact and operate primarily on GitHub, an online version control and task management platform. Over 110,000 GitHub repositories  and  6,500  packages  depend  on  SciPy 43 .  Some  of  the major feature highlights from the three years preceding SciPy 1.0

![Figure 1](./img/figure1.png)

are discussed in the 'Key technical improvements' section below, and milestones in its history are highlighted in Fig. 1.

## Architecture and implementation choices

Project scope. SciPy provides fundamental algorithms for scientific computing. The breadth of its scope was derived from the guide to available mathematical software (GAMS) classification system 44 . In areas that move relatively slowly, for example, linear algebra, SciPy aims to provide complete coverage. In other areas it aims to provide fundamental building blocks while interacting well with other packages specialized in that area. For example, SciPy provides what one  expects  to  find  in  a  statistics  textbook  (probability  distributions,  hypothesis  tests,  frequency  statistics,  correlation  functions, and more), whereas Statsmodels 45 provides more advanced statistical estimators and inference methods, scikit-learn 3 covers machine learning,  and  PyMC3 46 ,  emcee 47 and  PyStan  (http://mc-stan.org) cover Bayesian statistics and probabilistic modeling. scikit-image 4 provides  image  processing  capabilities  beyond  SciPy's ndimage , SymPy 48 provides a Python interface for symbolic computation, and sparse.csgraph and spatial offer  basic  tools  for  working with graphs and networks compared to specialized libraries such as NetworkX 49 .

We use the following criteria to determine whether to include new functionality in SciPy:

- The algorithm is of relevance to multiple fields of science.
- The  algorithm  is  demonstrably  important.  For  example,  it  is classic enough to be included in textbooks, or it is based on a peer-reviewed article that has a substantial number of citations.

In  terms  of  software  systems  and  architecture,  SciPy's  scope matches NumPy's: algorithms for in-memory computing on single machines, with support for a wide range of data types and process architectures. Distributed computing and support for graphics processing units (GPUs) were explicitly out of scope at the 1.0 release point, but this has been revised in our roadmap (see Discussion).

Language  choices. According  to  analysis  using  the linguist library (https://github.com/github/linguist), SciPy is approximately 50% Python, 25% Fortran, 20% C, 3% Cython and 2% C ++ , with a dash of TeX, Matlab, shell script and Make. The distribution of secondary programming languages in SciPy is a compromise between a  powerful,  performance-enhancing  language  that  interacts  well with  Python  (that  is,  Cython)  and  the  usage  of  languages  (and their libraries) that have proven reliable and performant over many decades.

Fortran, despite its age, is still a high-performance scientific programming language  with  continued  contemporary  usage 50 .  Thus, we  wrap  the  following  excellent,  field-tested  Fortran  libraries  to provide  Python  convenience  while  benefiting  from  their  performance: QUADPACK 51  and ODEPACK 52  for numerical integration and  solution  of  initial  value  problems;  FITPACK 53 ,  ODRPACK 54 and MINPACK 55  for curve-fitting and least-squares minimization; FFTPACK 56,57 for  performing  Fourier  transforms;  ARPACK 58 for solving eigenvalue problems; ALGORITHM 644 (ref.  59 ) for computing  Bessel  functions;  and  CDFLIB 60 for  evaluating  cumulative density functions.

Rounding out the top three languages in  SciPy  is  C,  which  is also extremely well-established over several decades 61 of  scientific computing. The C libraries that we wrap in SciPy include trlib 62 for optimization, SuperLU 63,64 for solving sparse linear systems, Qhull 65 for  computational  geometry  and  Cephes  (http://www.netlib.org/ cephes/) for special functions.

Cython has been described as a creole language that mixes the best parts of Python and lower-level C/C ++ paradigms 40 . We often use Cython as a glue between well-established, low-level scientific

Fig. 1 | Major milestones from SciPy's initial release in 2001 to the release of SciPy 1.0 in 2017. Note that SciKits and GitHub have been introduced in the Background section; more information about Cython and SciPy subpackages (for example, scipy.sparse ) is available in the 'Architecture and implementation choices' section, BLAS/LAPACK support is detailed in the 'Key technical improvements' section, and continuous integration is discussed in the 'T est and benchmark suite' section.

computing  libraries  written  in  C/C ++ and  the  Python  interface offered by SciPy. We also use Cython to enable performance enhancements in Python code, especially for cases where heavily used inner loops benefit from a compiled code with static typing.

For implementing new functionality, Python is the still the language of choice. If Python performance is an issue, then we prefer the use of Cython followed by C, C ++ or Fortran (in that order). The main motivation for this is maintainability: Cython has the highest abstraction level, and most Python developers will understand it. C is also widely known, and easier for the current core development team to manage than C ++ and especially Fortran.

The position that SciPy occupies near the foundation of the scientific Python ecosystem is such that adoption of new languages or major dependencies is generally unlikely; our choices are strongly driven  by  long-term  stability.  GPU  acceleration,  new  transpiling libraries  and  the  latest  JIT  compilation  approaches  (for  example, Numba 66 )  are  very  powerful  but  have  traditionally  fallen  outside the  remit  of  the  main  SciPy  library.  That  said,  we  have  recently increased our efforts to support compatibility with some of these options, and our full test suite passed with the PyPy JIT compiler 67 at the 1.0 release point.

API and ABI evolution. The  API  for  SciPy  consists  of  approximately 1,500 functions and classes. Our policy for evolving the API over time is that new functionality can be added, while removing or changing existing functionality can only be done if the benefits exceed the (often significant) costs to users and only after giving clear  deprecation  warnings  to  those  users  for  at  least  one  year. In general, we encourage changes that improve clarity in the API of the library but strongly discourage breaking backward compatibility,  given  our  position  near  the  base  of  the  scientific  Python computing stack.

In addition to the Python API, SciPy has C and Cython interfaces.  Therefore,  we  also  have  to  consider  the  application  binary interface (ABI). This ABI has been stable for a long time, and we aim to evolve it only in a backward-compatible way.

## Key technical improvements

Here  we  describe  key  technical  improvements  made  in  the  last three years.

Data structures. Sparse matrices. scipy.sparse offers  seven  sparse matrix  data  structures,  also  known  as  sparse  formats.  The  most important ones are the row- and column-compressed formats (CSR and  CSC,  respectively).  These  offer  fast  major-axis  indexing  and fast matrix-vector multiplication, and are used heavily throughout SciPy and dependent packages.

Over the last three years, our sparse matrix handling internals were rewritten and performance was improved. Iterating over and slicing of CSC and CSR matrices is now up to 35% faster, and the speed of coordinate (COO)/diagonal (DIA) to CSR/CSC matrix format conversions has increased. SuperLU 63 was updated to version

5.2.1, enhancing the low-level implementations leveraged by a subset of our sparse offerings.

From  a  new  features  standpoint, scipy.sparse matrices and linear operators now support the Python matrix multiplication ( @ )  operator.  We  added scipy.sparse.norm and scipy. sparse.random for computing sparse matrix norms and drawing random variates from arbitrary distributions, respectively. Also, we made a concerted effort to bring the scipy.sparse API into line with the equivalent NumPy API where possible.

cKDTree. The scipy.spatial.ckdtree module, which implements  a  space-partitioning  data  structure  that  organizes points  in k -dimensional  space,  was  rewritten  in  C ++ with  templated classes. Support was added for periodic boundary conditions, which are often used in simulations of physical processes.

In  2013,  the  time  complexity  of  the k -nearest-neighbor search from cKDTree.query was approximately loglinear 68 , consistent  with  its  formal  description 69 .  Since  then,  we  enhanced cKDTree.query by reimplementing it in  C ++ , removing memory leaks and allowing release of the global interpreter  lock (GIL)  so  that  multiple  threads  may  be  used 70 .  This  generally improved performance on any given problem while preserving the asymptotic complexity.

In 2015, SciPy added the sparse\_distance\_matrix routine for generating approximate sparse distance matrices between KDTree objects  by  ignoring  all  distances  that  exceed  a  userprovided value. This routine is not limited to the conventional L2 (Euclidean)  norm  but  supports  any  Minkowski p -norm  between 1 and infinity. By default, the returned data structure is a dictionary  of  keys  (DOK)-based  sparse  matrix,  which  is  very  efficient for  matrix  construction.  This  hashing  approach  to  sparse  matrix assembly  can  be  seven  times  faster  than  constructing  with  CSR format 71 ,  and  the  C ++ level  sparse  matrix  construction  releases the  Python  GIL  for  increased  performance.  Once  the  matrix  is constructed,  distance  value  retrieval  has  an  amortized  constant time complexity 72 ,  and  the  DOK structure can be efficiently converted to a CSR, CSC or COO matrix to allow for speedy arithmetic operations.

In  2015,  the cKDTree dual  tree  counting  algorithm 73 was enhanced to support weights 74 , which are essential in many scientific applications, for example, computing correlation functions of galaxies 75 .

Unified bindings to compiled code. LowLevelCallable. As of SciPy version 0.19, it is possible for users to wrap low-level functions in a scipy.LowLevelCallable object  that  reduces  the  overhead of calling compiled C functions, such as those generated using Numba or Cython, directly from Python. Supported low-level functions include PyCapsule objects, ctypes function pointers and cffi function pointers. Furthermore, it is possible to generate a low-level  callback  function  automatically  from  a  Cython  module using scipy.LowLevelCallable.from\_cython .

Optimization methods from minimize , which solves problems of the form f x min ( ) x , where ∈R x n and R R → f : n . 'Version added' specifies the algorithm's first appearance in SciPy. Algorithms with version added '0.6*' were added in version 0.6 or before. 'Wrapper' indicates whether the implementation available in SciPy wraps a function written in a compiled language (for example, C or FORTRAN). 'First derivatives' and 'second derivatives' indicate whether first or second order derivatives are required. When 'second derivatives' is flagged with '~', the algorithm accepts but does not require secondorder derivatives from the user; it computes an approximation internally and uses it to accelerate method convergence. 'Iterative Hessian factorization' denotes algorithms that factorize the Hessian in an iterative way, which does not require explicit matrix factorization or storage of the Hessian. 'Local convergence' gives a lower bound on the rate of convergence of the iteration sequence once the iterate is sufficiently close to the solution: linear (L), superlinear (S) and quadratic (Q). Convergence rates denoted S* indicate that the algorithm has a superlinear rate for the parameters used in SciPy, but can achieve a quadratic convergence rate with other parameter choices. 'Global convergence' is marked for the algorithms with guarantees of convergence to a stationary point (that is, a point x * for which ∇ = f x ( *) 0); this is not a guarantee of convergence to a global minimum. 'Lines-search' (LS) or 'trust-region' (TR) indicates which of the two globalization approaches is used by the algorithm. The table also indicates which algorithms can deal with constraints on the variables. We distinguish among bound constraints ( ≤ ≤ x x x l u ), equality constraints ( = c x ( ) 0 eq ) and inequality constraints ( ≥ c x ( ) 0 ineq ).

Cython bindings for BLAS, LAPACK and special . SciPy  has provided special functions and leveraged basic linear algebra subprograms (BLAS) and linear algebra package (LAPACK) 76 routines for many years. SciPy now additionally includes Cython 40 wrappers for many BLAS and LAPACK routines (added in 2015) and the special functions provided in the scipy.special subpackage (added in 2016), which are available in scipy.linalg.cython\_blas , scipy.linalg.cython\_lapack and scipy.special. cython\_special ,  respectively.  When  writing  algorithms  in Cython, it is typically more efficient to call directly into the libraries SciPy wraps rather than indirectly, using SciPy's Python APIs. These low-level interfaces for Cython can also be used outside of the SciPy codebase to gain access to the functions in the wrapped libraries while avoiding the overhead of Python function calls. This can give performance gains of one or two orders of magnitude for many use cases.

Developers can also use the low-level Cython interfaces without linking  against  the  wrapped  libraries 77 .  This  lets  other  extensions avoid  the  complexity  of  finding  and  using  the  correct  libraries. Avoiding  this  complexity  is  especially  important  when  wrapping libraries written in Fortran. Not only can these low-level wrappers be used without a Fortran compiler, they can also be used without having to handle all the different Fortran compiler ABIs and name mangling schemes.

Most of these low-level Cython wrappers are generated automatically to help with both correctness and ease of maintenance. The wrappers for BLAS and LAPACK are primarily generated using type information that is parsed from the BLAS and LAPACK source files using F2PY 19 , though a small number of routines use hand-written type signatures instead. The input and output types of each routine are saved in a data file that is read at build time and used to generate the corresponding Cython wrapper files. The wrappers in scipy. special.cython\_special are also generated from a data file containing type information for the wrapped routines.

Since SciPy can be built with LAPACK 3.4.0 or later, Cython wrappers are only provided for the routines that maintain a consistent interface  across  all  supported  LAPACK  versions.  The  standard BLAS interface provided by the various existing BLAS libraries is not currently changing, so changes are not generally needed in the wrappers provided by SciPy. Changes to the Cython wrappers for the functions in scipy.special follow corresponding changes to the interface of that subpackage.

Numerical  optimization. The scipy.optimize subpackage provides functions for the numerical solution of several classes of root finding and optimization problems. Here we highlight recent additions through SciPy 1.0.

Linear  optimization. A  new  interior-point  optimizer  for  continuous  linear  programming  problems, linprog with method  = 'interior-point' , was released with SciPy 1.0. Implementing the core algorithm of the commercial solver MOSEK 78 ,  it  solves all of the 90 + NETLIB LP benchmark problems 79  tested. Unlike some interior point methods, this homogeneous self-dual formulation provides certificates of infeasibility or unboundedness as appropriate.

A presolve routine 80 solves trivial problems and otherwise performs  problem  simplifications,  such  as  bound  tightening  and removal of fixed  variables,  and  one  of  several  routines  for  eliminating  redundant  equality  constraints  is  automatically  chosen to  reduce  the  chance  of  numerical  difficulties  caused  by  singular matrices. Although the main solver implementation is pure Python, end-to-end sparse matrix support and heavy use of SciPy's compiled linear system solvers-often for the same system with multiple right hand  sides  owing  to  the  predictor-corrector  approach-provide speed sufficient  for  problems  with  tens  of  thousands  of  variables and constraints.

Nonlinear optimization: local minimization. The minimize function provides a unified interface for finding local minima of nonlinear  optimization problems. Four new methods for unconstrained optimization were added to minimize in recent versions of SciPy: dogleg , trust-ncg , trust-exact and trust-krylov .

All are trust-region methods that build a local model of the objective  function  based  on  first  and  second  derivative  information, approximate the best point within a local 'trust region' and iterate until a local minimum of the original objective function is reached, but  each  has  unique  characteristics  that  make  it  appropriate  for certain types of problems. For instance, trust-exact achieves fast  convergence  by  solving  the  trust-region  subproblem  almost exactly, but it requires the second derivative Hessian matrix to be stored and factored every iteration, which may preclude the solution of large problems ( ≥ 1,000 variables). In contrast, trust-ncg and trust-krylov are  well  suited  to  large-scale  optimization problems because they do not need to store and factor the Hessian explicitly,  instead  using  second  derivative  information  in  a  faster, approximate way. We compare the characteristics of all minimize methods in detail in Table 1, which illustrates the level of completeness that SciPy aims for when covering a numerical method or topic.

Nonlinear  optimization:  global  minimization. As minimize may return  any  local  minimum,  some  problems  require  the  use  of  a global optimization routine. The new scipy.optimize.dif-ferential\_evolution function 81,82 is a stochastic global optimizer that works by evolving a population of candidate solutions. In  each  iteration,  trial  candidates  are  generated  by  combination of candidates from the existing population. If the trial candidates represent  an  improvement, then the population is updated. Most recently, the SciPy benchmark suite gained a comprehensive set of 196 global optimization problems for tracking the performance of existing  solvers  over  time  and  for  evaluating  whether  the  performance of new solvers merits their inclusion in the package.

Statistical  distributions. The scipy.stats subpackage  contains more than 100 probability distributions: 96 continuous and 13 discrete univariate distributions, and 10 multivariate distributions. The implementation relies on a consistent framework that provides methods  to  sample  random  variates,  to  evaluate  the  cumulative distribution  function  (CDF)  and  the  probability  density  function (PDF), and to fit parameters for every distribution. Generally, the methods  rely  on  specific  implementations  for  each  distribution, such as a closed-form expression of the CDF or a sampling algorithm, if available. Otherwise, default methods are used based on generic  code,  for  example,  numerical  integration  of  the  PDF  to obtain the CDF. Key recent distributions added to scipy.stats include  the  histogram-based  distribution  in scipy.stats. rv\_histogram and  the  multinomial  distribution  in scipy.

stats.multinomial (used,  for  example,  in  natural  language processing 83 ).

Polynomial interpolators. Historically, SciPy relied heavily on the venerable FITPACK Fortran library by P. Dierckx 53,84 for univariate interpolation  and  approximation  of  data,  but  the  original  monolithic design and API for interaction between SciPy and FITPACK was limiting for both users and developers.

Implementing a new, modular design of polynomial interpolators was spread over several releases. The goals of this effort were to have a set of basic objects representing piecewise polynomials, to implement a collection of algorithms for constructing various interpolators, and to provide users with building blocks for constructing additional interpolators.

At the lowest level of the new design are classes that represent univariate  piecewise  polynomials: PPoly (SciPy  0.13) 85 , BPoly (SciPy  0.13)  and BSpline (SciPy  0.19) 86 ,  which  allow  efficient vectorized  evaluations,  differentiation,  integration  and  root-finding. PPoly represents  piecewise  polynomials  in  the  power  basis in terms of breakpoints and coefficients at each interval. BPoly is similar and represents piecewise polynomials in the Bernstein basis (which  is  suitable,  for  example,  for  constructing  Bézier  curves). BSpline represents spline curves, that is, linear combinations of B-spline basis elements 87 .

In the next layer, these polynomial classes are used to construct several common ways of interpolating data: CubicSpline (SciPy 0.18) 88 constructs  a  twice  differentiable  piecewise  cubic  function, Akima1DInterpolator and PCHIPInterpolator implement  two  classic  prescriptions  for  constructing  a C 1 continuous monotone shape-preserving interpolator 89,90 .

Test and benchmark suite. Test suite. Test-driven development has been described as a way to manage fear and uncertainty when making code changes 91 . For each component of SciPy, we write multiple small executable tests that verify its intended behavior. The collection of these, known as a 'test suite' , increases confidence in the correctness and accuracy of the library, and allows us to make code modifications  known  not  to  alter  desired  behavior.  According  to the practice of continuous integration 92 , all proposed contributions to SciPy are temporarily integrated with the master branch of the library before the test suite is run, and all tests must be passed before the contribution is permanently merged. Continuously monitoring the number of lines of code in SciPy covered by unit tests is one way we maintain some certainty that changes and new features are correctly implemented.

The SciPy test suite is orchestrated by a continuous integration matrix  that  includes  POSIX  and  Windows  (32/64-bit)  platforms managed by Travis CI and AppVeyor, respectively. Our tests cover Python  versions  2.7,  3.4,  3.5,  3.6,  and  include  code  linting  with pyflakes and pycodestyle . There are more than 13,000 unit tests in the test suite, which is written for usage with the pytest (https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest)  framework.  In  Fig.  2,  we  show historical  test  coverage  data  generated  using  a  Docker-based approach  (https://github.com/tylerjereddy/scipy-cov-track).  With the exception of the removal of ∼ 61,000 lines of compiled code for SciPy v0.14, the volume of both compiled (C, C ++ and  Fortran) and Python code has increased between releases, as have the number  of  lines  covered  by  unit  tests.  Test  coverage  at  the  SciPy  1.0 release point was at 87% for Python code according to pytestcov (https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/).  Coverage  of  compiled (C,  C ++ and  Fortran)  code  was  only  45%  according  to gcov (https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html),  but  the  compiled codebase  is  much  more  robust  than  this  figure  would  suggest  as the  figure  does  not  correct  for  the  inclusion  of  reputable  vendor code, the original library of which is well-tested; generated code, for which full coverage is impractical; and deprecated code, which does

not require unit tests. Documentation for the code is automatically built and published by the CircleCI service to facilitate evaluation of documentation changes/integrity.

Benchmark suite. In  addition  to  ensuring  that  unit  tests  are  passing, it  is  important to confirm that the performance of the SciPy codebase  improves  over  time.  Since  February  2015,  the  performance of SciPy has been monitored with Airspeed Velocity ( asv https://github.com/airspeed-velocity/asv).  SciPy's run.py script conveniently wraps asv features such that benchmark results over time can be generated with a single console command. For example, in Fig. 3 we illustrate the improvement of scipy.spatial. cKDTree.query over roughly nine years of project history. The tree  used  in  the  benchmark  was  generated  without  application of  toroidal  topology  ( boxsize  =  None ),  and  tests  were  performed by Airspeed Velocity 0.4 using Python 2.7, NumPy 1.8.2 and Cython  versions  0.27.3,  0.21.1  and  0.18  (for  improved  backward compatibility).  Substantial  performance  improvements  were  realized  when cKDTree was fully Cythonized and again when it was rewritten in C ++ .

## Project organization and community

Governance. SciPy  adopted  an  official  governance  document (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/dev/governance/governance.html) on August 3, 2017. A steering council, currently composed of 18 members, oversees daily development of the project by contributing code and reviewing contributions from the community.  Council  members have commit rights to the project repository, but they are expected to merge changes only when there are no substantive community objections. The chair of the steering council,  Ralf  Gommers, is responsible for initiating biannual technical reviews of project direction and summarizing any private council activities to the broader community. The project's benevolent dictator for life, Pauli Virtanen, has overruling authority on any matter, but is expected to act in good faith and only exercise this authority when the steering council cannot reach agreement.

SciPy's  official  code  of  conduct  was  approved  on  October  24, 2017.  In  summary,  there  are  five  specific  guidelines:  be  open  to everyone  participating  in  our  community;  be  empathetic  and patient in resolving conflicts; be collaborative, as we depend on each other to build the library; be inquisitive, as early identification of issues can prevent serious consequences; and be careful with wording. The code of conduct specifies how breaches can be reported to a code of conduct committee and outlines procedures for the committee's response. Our diversity statement 'welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. '

Maintainers and contributors. The SciPy project has ~100 unique contributors for every 6-month release cycle. Anyone with the interest and skills can become a contributor; the SciPy contributor guide (https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/contributor/contributor\_toc. html) provides guidance on how to do that. In addition, the project currently has 15 active (volunteer) maintainers: people who review the contributions of others and do everything else needed to ensure that  the  software  and  the  project  move  forward.  Maintainers  are critical to the health of the project 93 ; their skills and efforts largely determine how fast the project progresses, and they enable input from the much larger group of contributors. Anyone can become a maintainer, too, as they are selected on a rolling basis from contributors with a substantial history of high-quality contributions.

Funding. The  development  cost  of  SciPy  is  estimated  in  excess of  10  million  dollars  by  Open  Hub  (https://www.openhub.net/p/ scipy/estimated\_cost). Yet the project is largely unfunded, having been  developed  predominantly  by  graduate  students,  faculty  and members of industry in their free time. Small amounts of funding have been applied with success: some meetings were sponsored by universities and industry, Google's Summer of Code program supported infrastructure and algorithm work, and teaching grant funds were used early on to develop documentation. However, funding from  national  agencies,  foundations  and  industry  has  not  been commensurate with the enormous stack of important software that relies on SciPy. More diverse spending to support planning, development, management and infrastructure would help SciPy remain a  healthy  underpinning  of  international  scientific  and  industrial endeavors.

Downstream projects. The  scientific  Python  ecosystem  includes many examples of domain-specific software libraries  building  on top of SciPy features and then returning to the base SciPy library to suggest and even implement improvements. For example, there are common contributors to the SciPy and Astropy core libraries 94 , and what works well for one of the codebases, infrastructures or communities  is  often  transferred  in  some  form  to  the  other.  At the  codebase  level,  the binned\_statistic functionality  is one  such  cross-project  contribution:  it  was  initially  developed  in

an Astropy-affiliated package and then placed in SciPy afterward. In this perspective, SciPy serves as a catalyst for cross-fertilization throughout the Python scientific computing community.

## Discussion

SciPy has a strong developer community and a massive user base. GitHub traffic metrics report roughly 20,000 unique visitors to the source website between 14 May 2018 and 27 May 2018 (near the time of writing), with 721 unique copies ('clones') of the codebase over that time period. The developer community at that time consisted of 610 unique contributors of source code, with more than 19,000 commits accepted into the codebase (GitHub page data).

From the user side, there were 13,096,468 downloads of SciPy from the  Python  Packaging  Index  (PyPI) 95 and  5,776,017  via  the default channel of the conda (https://github.com/ContinuumIO/ anaconda-package-data)  package  manager  during  the  year  2017. These  numbers  establish  a  lower  bound  on  the  total  number  of downloads by users given that PyPI and conda are  only  two  of several  popular  methods  for  installing  SciPy.  The  SciPy  website (http://www.scipy.org/), which has been the default citation in the absence of a peer-reviewed paper, has been cited over 3,000 times (https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites = 2086009121748039507). Some of the  most  prominent  uses  of  or  demonstrations  of  credibility  for  SciPy  include  the  LIGO-Virgo  scientific  collaboration that  lead  to  the  observation  of  gravitational  waves 96 ,  the  fact  that SciPy is shipped directly with macOS and in the Intel distribution for Python 97 , and that SciPy is used by 47% of all machine learning projects  on  GitHub  (https://github.blog/2019-01-24-the-state-ofthe-octoverse-machine-learning/).

Nevertheless,  SciPy  continually  strives  to  improve.  The  SciPy Roadmap (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.0.0/reference/roadmap.html, https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/roadmap.html), summarized in Table 2, is a continually updated document maintained by the community that describes some of the major directions for improvement  for  the  project,  as  well  as  specific  limitations  and matters that require assistance moving forward. In addition to the items on the roadmap, we are still working to increase the number of  SciPy  usage  tutorials  beyond  our  current  15  section  offering. Also, the low-level Cython code in our library (which interacts with C-level code and exposes it for Python usage) could use some measure of modernization, including migration to typed memoryviews to handle NumPy arrays.

A problem faced by many open-source projects is attracting and retaining  developers.  Although  it  is  normal  for  some  individuals to contribute to a project for a while and then move on, too much turnover can result in the loss of institutional memory, leading to mistakes of the past being repeated, APIs of new code becoming inconsistent with the old code and a drifting project scope. We are fortunate that the SciPy project continues to attract enthusiastic and competent new developers while maintaining the involvement of a small but dedicated old guard. There are contributors who were present in the early years of the project who still contribute to discussions of bug reports and reviews of new code contributions. Our benevolent dictator for life has been with the project for more than 10 years and is still actively contributing code, and the head of our steering council, who also acts as a general manager, is approaching his eleventh anniversary. An additional half dozen or so active developers have been contributing steadily for five or more years. The combination of a committed old guard and a host of new contributors ensures that SciPy will continue to grow while maintaining a high level of quality.

A final important challenge to address is the accommodation of GPU and distributed  computing  without  disrupting  our  conventional and heavily used algorithm/API infrastructure. Although the exact approach we will adopt across the entire library to leverage these emerging technologies remains unclear, and was not a priority at the 1.0 release point, we now have a concrete implementation of a subpackage that allows for the experimental use of multiple backends, such as GPU-tractable data structures, in the new scipy. fft . This will be described in detail in a future report.
